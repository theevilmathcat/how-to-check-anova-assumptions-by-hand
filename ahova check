Checking One-Way ANOVA Assumptions by Hand: Weightlifting Example
This guide explains how to check the three main assumptions for one-way ANOVA by hand using the same weightlifting data from before. The assumptions are:

Independence: Observations are independent within and between groups.
Normality: Residuals (errors) are normally distributed.
Homogeneity of variances (equal variances across groups).

We'll use the same sample data (maximum squat in kg, n=5 per group):

Group A: 100, 105, 110, 115, 120 (mean = 110)
Group B: 110, 115, 120, 125, 130 (mean = 120)
Group C: 120, 125, 130, 135, 140 (mean = 130)

Grand mean = 120. From previous ANOVA: MSW = 62.5 (pooled within-group variance).
Assumption 1: Independence
This is not tested statistically by hand — it's ensured by study design.

Observations should be independent: no pairing, no repeated measures on the same person, random assignment/sampling.
In our example: Assume lifters are different individuals, randomly assigned to training programs, and lifts measured independently.
If violated (e.g., same lifter in multiple groups), ANOVA is inappropriate — use repeated-measures ANOVA instead.

If design ensures independence, assumption met.
Assumption 2: Normality of Residuals
Strictly, check normality of residuals (observed value - predicted value). Predicted = group mean.
Residuals are the deviations within each group (same as used for SSW).
All residuals (pooled, N=15):
Group A: -10, -5, 0, +5, +10
Group B: -10, -5, 0, +5, +10
Group C: -10, -5, 0, +5, +10
(The data is symmetric and patterned — residuals identical per group.)
To check by hand:

Graphical (preferred for small n): Plot histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals.
Here, residuals range from -10 to +10 in steps of 5, symmetric around 0 → looks normal (bell-shaped if histogrammed).
No skewness or outliers.

Descriptive: Calculate skewness and kurtosis (should be near 0 for normal).
Data symmetric → skewness = 0.
Kurtosis = 0 (uniform-like in spread, but small n).

Formal test: Shapiro-Wilk is powerful but requires tables/coefficients (hard by hand for n=15). For small n, visual is sufficient.
Alternative: With such perfect symmetry and no outliers, normality is reasonable.
Note: ANOVA robust to mild non-normality, especially equal n.


Conclusion: Assumption met.
Assumption 3: Homogeneity of Variances (Equal Variances)
Check if group variances are equal.
First, calculate variance per group (s² = sum(deviations²) / (n-1)):
Each group: deviations² = 100 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 100 = 250
df = 4 → variance = 250 / 4 = 62.5 for each group.
All variances exactly equal (62.5).

Rule of thumb: Largest variance / smallest < 2–4 (here 1 → fine).
Graphical: Boxplots would show similar spread.
Formal test by hand: Levene's test (robust).
Use absolute deviations from group mean (or median for more robustness).
Here, absolute deviations per group (same for all): 10, 5, 0, 5, 10
Mean absolute deviation per group = (10+5+0+5+10)/5 = 30/5 = 6
Now treat these absolutes as new data, run one-way ANOVA on them.
Grand mean of absolutes = 6 (all groups same).
SSB = 0 (all group means = 6).
F = 0 → p = 1 (not significant).
Conclusion: No evidence against equal variances.


Alternative simple test (Hartley's Fmax for equal n): max variance / min variance = 1 → not significant.
Conclusion: Assumption clearly met.
Overall Summary
In this weightlifting example:

Independence: Met by design.
Normality: Met (symmetric residuals, no issues).
Homogeneity: Met (identical variances).

All assumptions satisfied → standard one-way ANOVA (and post hoc tests) are appropriate.
In real data:

Independence: Always check design.
Normality: Use Q-Q plots/histograms of residuals; ANOVA robust if n>10–15 per group.
Homogeneity: If violated and unequal n, use Welch ANOVA instead.

For critical values (e.g., F tables, t tables), refer to a statistics textbook. Small deviations often ok due to ANOVA robustness with equal group sizes.
